<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested the creation of a modern, minimalist academic portfolio website. Initially, the request was for a frontend-only site, but it evolved to include a backend service to automatically fetch and display publications from the user's Google Scholar profile.

The user iteratively provided content and requested features, including:
- Automatic publication updates from a specific Google Scholar URL.
- A specific Modern Minimalist design.
- A reordering of page sections, moving Recent News to be more prominent.
- Upload and integration of a profile photo, a CV PDF, a Teaching Philosophy PDF, and 15 photos for lab members.
- Addition of a diagram (initially PDF, then a displayable PNG) with a caption to a news item, and resizing it for better presentation.
- A fix for a broken link and a general request to verify all links on the site.
- A cosmetic request to rename all project-related directories from emergent to Prince.
- A request for a deployment health check.
- Comprehensive, step-by-step deployment guides for both AWS and a local Linux server, including how to handle self-hosting of assets (images, PDFs).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack academic portfolio website has been built.
-   **Frontend**: A responsive React application styled with TailwindCSS and using ShadCN UI components. It features sections for Home/Bio, News, Teaching, Research, Publications, Lab, Service, and Contact. All content is dynamically loaded from a central  file, making it easy for the user to update.
-   **Backend**: A FastAPI server with an endpoint () that scrapes the user's Google Scholar page using  to provide real-time publication data. It includes caching and robust error handling.
-   **Content Integration**: The user's profile photo, CV, teaching philosophy, and all 15 lab member photos are integrated and functional. The Google Scholar integration is working correctly. The news section includes a diagram with a caption as requested.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user requested a dedicated folder with documentation and scripts to deploy the website on a local Linux server.
-   Status: FINISHED
-   Agent Testing Done: Y
-   Which testing method agent to use? NA
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or tasks. All user requests have been addressed. The project is in a state of completion, pending user-initiated updates or deployment.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **P1: Replace Placeholder Content**: The user needs to update the remaining placeholder content in . This includes:
    - Dummy diagrams and captions for two Recent News articles.
    - Links for course syllabi and student projects.
    - URLs for social media profiles (ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub).
    - URLs for individual lab member websites.
- **P2: Deploy the Website**: The user will likely follow the created deployment guides ( or the  folder) to host the website, which may lead to follow-up questions.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Website Scaffolding**: Built a full-stack academic portfolio with React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Google Scholar Integration**: Created a backend service to scrape and display publications, including author stats (citations, h-index).
- **UI/UX Development**: Implemented all sections (Home, News, Teaching, etc.) with a modern, minimalist design and responsive layout.
- **Content Integration**: Successfully uploaded and linked the user's profile photo, CV, teaching philosophy PDF, and 15 lab member photos.
- **Feature Implementation**: Added a diagram with a caption to the news section and resized it based on user feedback.
- **Bug Fixes & Verification**: Fixed a non-functional Download PDF button and performed a site-wide link check.
- **Project Customization**: Renamed internal project directories from  to  as requested.
- **Documentation**: Created extensive documentation for:
    - Content updates ().
    - Deployment on AWS ().
    - Deployment on a local Linux server (a full  directory with guides, scripts, and configs).
    - Status reports (, ).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI components
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
-   **Data Fetching**: Frontend uses  API to get data from the backend.
-   **Web Scraping**:  and  are used on the backend to parse the Google Scholar HTML page.
-   **Content Management**: A single JavaScript file () acts as a simple, file-based CMS for easy updates.
-   **Deployment Strategy**: The agent provided comprehensive guides for self-hosting on both AWS (EC2) and a generic Linux server, including asset management.

**key DB schema**
-   : 
    -   *Note: This is part of the initial boilerplate and is not used by the core application features. All content is either hardcoded in  or scraped live from Google Scholar.*

**All files of reference**
-   : The most critical file for the user to edit for content updates.
-   : Contains the Google Scholar scraping logic.
-   : Consumes the scraped scholar data.
-   : Renders news items, including the custom diagram.
-   : Directory containing all files for local deployment.
-   : The guide for AWS deployment.

========================================: Script provided to help the user self-host images and PDFs.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches publications and author statistics for the given Google Scholar user ID.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user's primary method for updating website content is by editing the  file. This is by design for simplicity.
-   All user-provided assets (images, PDFs) are currently hosted on Emergent's servers. The user has been instructed on how to download these assets using the ========================================

======================================== script and self-host them as part of the deployment process. The deployment guides reflect this.
-   The project has been finalized from a feature perspective. Any new requests would likely be related to deployment troubleshooting or minor content/styling adjustments.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Requested a deployment guide for AWS. (Completed)
2.  **User:** Requested an alternative deployment guide for a local Linux server. (Completed)
3.  **User:** Uploaded a PDF diagram for a news item and provided a caption. (Completed)
4.  **User:** Requested to replace the PDF diagram with a displayable PNG image. (Completed)
5.  **User:** Requested to decrease the size of the diagram as it looked too big. (Completed)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: None. All features are functional.
-   **Mocked**: Some content in  remains as placeholders for the user to update (e.g., social links, some news diagrams, syllabi). The application structure is complete.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google Scholar**: The application scrapes the user's public Google Scholar profile. This is not a formal API and relies on the stability of Google's HTML structure. It does not require any API keys.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES. The agent used screenshot and curl commands to manually test UI and backend changes throughout the process, including after fixing links and updating content.
-   **Test files created**: None. Testing was performed manually.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent successfully executed all user requests and did not overlook any tasks mentioned in the conversation. The agent was proactive in providing comprehensive documentation and addressing the nuanced aspects of deployment, such as asset self-hosting.</analysis>
